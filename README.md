# IMDB-Movie-Recommendation-and-Performance-analysis

## Business Problem and Objective
In the modern entertainment industry, users are often overwhelmed by the vast selection of movies available across various streaming platforms. Traditional search and filtering mechanisms are insufficient in delivering personalized recommendations, resulting in a suboptimal user experience and decreased engagement.

The IMDb dataset provides comprehensive information about movies, including revenue, budget, user ratings, and other attributes. However, users frequently struggle to discover movies that align with their preferences due to the extensive range of available options. A well-designed recommendation system can address this challenge by offering tailored movie suggestions, thereby enhancing user experience and engagement.

To mitigate this issue, the objective of this project is to develop a Movie Recommendation System leveraging IMDb data. The system will analyze user preferences, movie attributes, and historical interactions to generate personalized recommendations, ultimately improving user satisfaction and retention.

By implementing content-based filtering techniques, the recommendation system aims to enhance movie discovery, increase watch time, and drive user engagement, benefiting both streaming platforms and end-users.
